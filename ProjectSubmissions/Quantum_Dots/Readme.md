## Ideas Behind the Project

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**:
   - Demonstrates the vulnerability of classical cryptographic systems (e.g., RSA) to quantum attacks.
   - Highlights the need for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

2. **Quantum Simulation**:
   - Simulates quantum algorithms like Shor's Algorithm to understand their impact on cryptography.
   - Provides a hands-on introduction to quantum computing.

3. **Quantum Decision Tree (QDT)**:
   - A placeholder model to evaluate the security of cryptographic keys.
   - Can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated quantum-resistant metrics.

4. **Educational Tool**:
   - Helps users understand the principles of quantum computing and its implications for cryptography.
   - Provides a practical example of integrating classical and quantum computing.

## Testing with 128-bit Integers

- The **128-bit composite number** generated in this project is **for testing purposes only**.
- It is used to simulate Shor's Algorithm in a controlled environment and demonstrate the workflow.
- In real-world scenarios, cryptographic systems use much larger keys (e.g., 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA) for security.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Implement Actual Shor's Algorithm**:
   - Extend the quantum circuit to fully implement Shor's Algorithm.

2. **Add Post-Quantum Algorithms**:
   - Include post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like Lattice-based or Hash-based signatures.

3. **Improve QDT Model**:
   - Develop a more sophisticated Quantum Decision Tree model based on real-world quantum-resistant metrics.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Build a web-based or command-line interface for easier interaction.
